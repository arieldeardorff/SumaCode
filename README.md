# SumaCode

Code for cleaning data from the Suma library assessment tool

Suma is a tablet-based toolkit for collecting, managing, and analyzing data about the usage of physical spaces developed by NCSU Libraries. More info here: https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/projects/suma

The goal of this code is to take the raw data from Suma and transform it into a format that is more easily analyzed in Tableau.
